# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel

I am a passionate Backend JavaScript | TypeScript developer with a strong entrepreneurial spirit. Driven by the idea of building value adding software to be proud of, I am eager to learn and take on complex projects. I strive in a collaborative environment where I can share my enthusiasm for coding and problem solving. To combine my passion for coding and entrepreneurship I co-founded Apptece on which I work in my free time as both, back-end engineer and business developer.

## Love to work with:
   ```bash
  > Nestjs
  > Express

## Curious to keep learning:
   ```bash
  > Vue
  > GraphQL
   ```
